# Poem About Astronomy

In the vast expanse of night,
The stars twinkle like diamonds in light.
Majestic planets in their orbit,
Each with secrets yet to be discovered.

The moon above, a silent sentry,
Guiding ships on voyages far and wide.
Astronomy, a language of stars,
Decoding the universe's endless bars.

From the Big Bang to cosmic rays,
A journey through time and space, both great and small.
Black holes, nebulae, galaxies in motion,
All under the watchful eye of the cosmos' creation.

Through telescopes we peer into the deep,
Unveiling mysteries that have been kept.
The stars whisper secrets from their light,
As we marvel at the beauty of the night.
